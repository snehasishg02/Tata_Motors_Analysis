# Tata_Motors_Analysis
In this project, I analysis Tata Motor's historical financial statements like Cash flow statement, P&L statement & Balance sheet. Hence I go for Ratio Analysis, then create a 5 years forecasting using the historicals & a common size statement. At last I go for Dupont Analysis for better understanding.
